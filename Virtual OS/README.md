# Virtual-OS-GoLang

#### Hey there, 

### This is a simple virtual operating system built in [Go Programming language](https://golang.org/) using [fyne.io](https://developer.fyne.io/) UI Toolkit.
This OS has some common apps used in day-to-day basis. I've built basic apps in GoLang using an intelligible and easy to grasp UI toolkit "fyne" and some external packages as per usage.
